# United-Planet-Internship
My main responsbilities in this internship was to organize volunteer abroad materials such as the scholarship application page, departure powerpoints, etc. During my time there, I also volunteered to complete small projects to help consolidate data from past participants. Given a csv file of 60 survey responses across five questions, I prepared the content by splicing long sentences, and removing punctuation/extra spaces/capital letters using Python Data Frames. I then used nltk.word_tokenize() to find the most frequent words for each survey question. Results were summarized in a powerpoint for my supervisors to help make decisions on program planning.
